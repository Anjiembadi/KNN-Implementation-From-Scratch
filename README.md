In this project, I tried to predict diamond prices using the KNN algorithm. First, I cleaned the dataset and handled both numerical and categorical columns using encoding and scaling. Then I wrote the KNN logic completely from scratch by calculating distances and finding nearest neighbors. After that, I compared my results with sklearn’s KNN model, and both gave almost the same accuracy, which shows that my scratch implementation is working correctly.
